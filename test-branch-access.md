# Branch-Based Access Control Implementation

## âœ… Implemented Features:

### 1. **Branch Access Utilities** (`/src/utils/branchAccess.ts`)
- `getUserBranchInfo()` - Get user role and branch
- `shouldFilterByBranch()` - Check if user needs branch filtering
- `getBranchFilter()` - Get branch filter for current user
- `getAllowedBranches()` - Get allowed branches for forms

### 2. **Updated Pages:**
- **Ready Stock** (`/app/ready/page.tsx`) - âœ… Branch filtering for display only
- **Gudang** (`/app/gudang/page.tsx`) - âœ… Branch filtering for display only  
- **Analysis** (`/app/analysis/page.tsx`) - âœ… Branch filtering AFTER calculations
- **Login** (`/app/login/page.tsx`) - âœ… Store cabang info
- **Dashboard** (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) - âœ… Display branch info

### 3. **Access Control Rules:**
- **Admin & Manager**: Can see ALL branches
- **PIC Branch**: Can only see their assigned branch
- **Staff**: Can see ALL branches (no restriction)

### 4. **Critical Safety Measures:**
- âœ… Branch filtering applied ONLY to display data
- âœ… Calculations done BEFORE filtering
- âœ… Analysis calculations remain unaffected
- âœ… Historical data for calculations preserved

## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios:

### Test 1: PIC Depok Login
1. Login as PIC with `cabang: "Depok"`
2. Should only see Depok branch data in:
   - Ready Stock
   - Gudang
   - Analysis
3. Forms should only show Depok branch option

### Test 2: Admin/Manager Login  
1. Login as Admin/Manager
2. Should see ALL branch data
3. All calculations should remain accurate

### Test 3: Calculation Integrity
1. Compare analysis results before/after implementation
2. Verify keluar_form, selisih calculations unchanged
3. Verify branch filtering doesn't affect buffer date logic

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes:
- Branch filtering is frontend-only (for UI convenience)
- Backend should implement proper RLS (Row Level Security)
- Current implementation is for user experience, not security
